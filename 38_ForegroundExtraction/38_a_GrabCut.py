'''
Foreground extrac is any technique which allows an imageâ€™s foreground to be extracted for further processing like object recognition, tracking etc.
The algorithm used for foreground extraction here is GrabCut Algorithm. In this algorithm,
the region is drawn in accordance with the foreground, a rectangle is drawn over it.
This is the rectangle that encases our main object. The region coordinates are decided over understanding the foreground mask.
But this segmentation is not perfect, as it may have marked some foreground region as background and vice versa. This problem can be avoided manually.
This foreground extraction technique functions just like a green screen in cinematics.


TSyntax: cv2.grabCut(image, mask, rectangle, backgroundModel, foregroundModel, iterationCount[, mode])

Parameters:
- image: Input 8-bit 3-channel image.
- mask: Input/output 8-bit single-channel mask. The mask is initialized by the function when mode is set to GC_INIT_WITH_RECT. Its elements may have one of following values:
    - GC_BGD defines an obvious background pixels.
    - GC_FGD defines an obvious foreground (object) pixel.
    - GC_PR_BGD defines a possible background pixel.
    - GC_PR_FGD defines a possible foreground pixel.
- rectangle: It is the region of interest containing a segmented object. The pixels outside of the ROI are marked as obvious background. The parameter is only used when mode==GC_INIT_WITH_RECT.
- backgroundModel: Temporary array for the background model.
- foregroundModel: Temporary array for the foreground model.
- iterationCount: Number of iterations the algorithm should make before returning the result. Note that the result can be refined with further calls with mode==GC_INIT_WITH_MASK or mode==GC_EVAL.
- mode: It defines the Operation mode. It can be one of the following:
    - GC_INIT_WITH_RECT: The function initializes the state and the mask using the provided rectangle. After that it runs iterCount iterations of the algorithm.
    - GC_INIT_WITH_MASK: The function initializes the state using the provided mask. Note that GC_INIT_WITH_RECT and GC_INIT_WITH_MASK can be combined. Then, all the pixels outside of the ROI are automatically initialized with GC_BGD.
    - GC_EVAL: The value means that the algorithm should just resume.
