'''
In Adaptive thresholding, the threshold value is calculated for smaller regions with different threshold values 
for different regions with respect to the change in lighting.

In Otsu Thresholding, a value of the threshold isnâ€™t chosen but is determined automatically.
A bimodal image (two distinct image values) is considered. The histogram generated contains two peaks.
So, a generic condition would be to choose a threshold value that lies in the middle of both the histogram peak values.

Syntax: cv2.threshold(source, thresholdValue, maxVal, thresholdingTechnique)

Parameters:
-> source: Input Image array (must be in Grayscale).
-> thresholdValue: Value of Threshold below and above which pixel values will change accordingly.
-> maxVal: Maximum value that can be assigned to a pixel.
-> thresholdingTechnique: The type of thresholding to be applied.
